Documentation: [Image Generation Doc](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images?lang=node.js&adobe_mc=MCMID%3D60047592739492077280307194424969051085%7CMCORGID%3DA8833BC75245AF9E0A490D4D%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1701353004&context=node) 

The Images API provides three methods for interacting with images:

1. Creating images from scratch based on a text prompt (DALL路E 3 and DALL路E 2)
2. Creating edited versions of images by having the model replace some areas of a pre-existing image, based on a new text prompt (DALL路E 2 only)
3. Creating variations of an existing image (DALL路E 2 only)

We are here, Using First method to create image from text prompt.
